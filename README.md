# DSA210 | Unofficial title: Exploring my dumbassery.

This is my Course Project for Introduction to Data Science (DSA-210 formerly CS-210) at Sabancı Üniversitesi, Fall 2024-2025.
This project is an analysis of my main physical and online activity of this semester.

## Motivation

Ever since the pandemic, I have had a major focus and productivity issue; downright crippling. In the years since my attention span and ability to persevere through hard tasks had gone to shreds, I have made small but cumulative efforts towards becoming the productive, ambitious and ever-achieving man I have wanted to become.
Two such changes were reducing my social media usage and increasing my physical activity. 
As this semester is the culmination of all of efforts so far, I want to do an analysis of how I stand against the pressures of university now, i.e: how physically active and online-ically deactive am I and do approaching deadlines and loads of classes cause any fluctations in there?
Only one way to find out.

## Data Sources

I will be doing a cross on my youtube activity, FitBit recordings, Location history as well as self-annotated important dates in the early weeks of this semester.
Data is collected from:
* Google takeout (Youtube, FitBit and location history)
* Self-annotations of semester deadlines and notable moments.

## Data Analysis Plan!!!
I want to observe the correlations between my activity, physical and online, and my school work (assignments and class hours) to see if certain days of the week or assignments/tests have influence over my activity.

### Hypotheses?
As some basic preliminary guesses as to the findings of my analyses:
* If I have more class hours on a day I will have less steps (paradoxically) on average because I know I tend to miss out on classes out of stress.
* If I have an assignment/test upcoming I will have higher zone minutes (indicating sports) on days leading up to them because I know I that I use basketball as a means of escapism.
* On days outside of campus I will have more steps on average because I spend more time on my feet while outside.
* On nights before tests I will have a higher Youtube watch time because I chronically procrastinate studying by watching Youtube videos

### Steps and Planned Procedure
The data from Google takeout is in multiple different file types (json, csv, etc) and so the first steps will be to start begin data visualisation.
I also plan on using an AI model to analyse the genre of the Youtube videos watched to see if there is a pattern to the kinds of videos I watch at certain specific times and semester situations.
After lots of visualisations of my activity I will begin finding correlations and exploring whether my hypotheses stand true and making further adjacent observations.
